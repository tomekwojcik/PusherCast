PusherCast
==========

PusherCast is a small demo app I wrote for the sake of getting to know Pusher.

Notes
-----
The Tornado app uses modified Pusher client library for Python to support Tornado's asynchronous requests. You can find the modified library here: https://github.com/tomekwojcik/pusher_client_python
